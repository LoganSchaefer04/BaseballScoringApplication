Baseball Scoring Application

Project Description
My baseball scoring application is an application that will allow users to fully input a full baseball game from start to finish.
I used JavaFX to create the entire UI because the UI is quite simple. No moving parts, just good ol' fashioned baseball scoring.
In the future, I want to accurately calculate win probability based on win probability dictated by any number of statistics.

I chose this project because I love baseball. I did not want to make a boring project that people see all the time. I want to be 
unique in making an application that can fully score a baseball game, calculate statistics, and analyze statistics that could be
used in a real baseball game to help coaches/managers make real game decisions with some button clicks.
